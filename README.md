biocMultiAssay
==============

This repo is intended to start the Bioconductor special interest group
on mergeable experiment collections like TCGA.  Our objective is to use R/Bioconductor
to define interfaces allowing efficient selection and combination of 
high-dimensional assays obtained on all or many members of a group of
samples or patients.

Please take a look look at the [API
Discussion](https://github.com/vjcitn/biocMultiAssay/issues/7), and
consider joining the [biocMultiAssay Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/biocmultiassay) to get
involved.
